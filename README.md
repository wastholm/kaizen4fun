# Kaizen for Fun and Profit

A presentation on how to apply the business philosophy kaizen to your personal life.


## Background

Trying to bring more order into my life, I have taken the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) and the [kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) philosophy and applied them to how I deal with tasks, changes and habits. I mentioned this in some social setting at some point and people convinced me to create a small presentation on how this works. This repo contains my slides in Markdown format, some images and a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) that assembles and launches the presentation, using [Revealup](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::revealup).


## Just Want to Have a Quick Look?

The presentation is [available on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/wastholm/kaizen-for-fun-and-profit). At least in my browser, there is some weird grid in the background that's not supposed to be there, but it should be perfectly readable anyway.


## Building

To build and launch the presentation, just run `make` without any arguments:

```
$ make
```

For this to work, you will need at least the following:

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), obviously.
* [ImageMagick](http://www.slideshare.net/wastholm/kaizen-for-fun-and-profit), to scale the images used in the presentation.
* [Revealup](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::revealup), to convert the Markdown file to an interactive browser-based presentation.
