## About Me ##

* IT consultant at [Kvadrat](http://www.kvadrat.se/). ![Kvadrat Logo](images/kvadrat-logo.jpg)
* Lots of side projects.
* Ambitions for world domination hampered by my forgetfulness and scattered-brained-ness.

---

## The Problem ##

![Whack-a-Mole](images/whack-a-mole.jennycu_flickr.jpg)

<!-- {notes}
* "Why didn't I do X? -- Something came up."
* Inspiration strikes at the wrong times.
* Hard to know what's most important to work on right now.
* I seem to  be going nowhere.
* Above all: I forget things.
{notes} -->

## I Know: I'll Use a To-Do List ##

![To-Do List](images/to-do_list.tmray02_flickr.jpg)

<!-- {notes}
If your life is this simple (and you are more than 11 years old), I salute you. Mine isn't. I need to be able to:

* Predict.
* Prioritize.
* Plan.
* Execute.

For this, I need tools of various kinds.

## Kaizen ##

<span style="font-size: 250%">改善</span>

<!-- {notes}
* kai·zen: improvement, "good change"
* Or in management, "continuous improvement".
{notes} -->

___

## Goals ##

* Don't forget stuff.
* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Do things at the right time.
* Do things in the right order.
* Visualize progress.
* Establish positive habits.
* Minimize "flutter".

___

### "Flutter"? ###

![Too Busy to Improve](images/too-busy.png)

<!-- {notes}
The better-known clutter uses up available space, thereby making it unavailable. Flutter does the same to time by filling it up with unproductive activities, leaving us fighting fires instead of preventing them, and struggling instead of improving.
{notes} -->

---

## The Scientific Method ##

* Hypothesize.
* Experiment.
* Analyze.
* Repeat.

---

## Improvement 1: Visualize Winning Streaks ##

![Wall Calendar](images/wall-calendar.sundazed_flickr.jpg)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Visualizing progress is a good motivator.
* How it works:
    * Every day you honestly feel you have done useful work towards reaching your goals, mark it in a calendar.
    * Soon you will have a "streak" or "chain" of marked days.
    * Don't break the chain!
* Good:
    * Visualizes progress.
    * Creates pressure to keep up the good work.
* Improve:
    * We need better precision.
    * Doesn't help us not forget stuff.
    * Log the actual achievements.

## Improvement 2: Write Down Tasks ##

![To-Do Tattoo](images/to-do-tattoo.robandstephanielevy_flickr.jpg)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Writing things down takes less time than worrying about them.
* How it works:
    * Use low- or high-tech tools to keep track of upcoming tasks.
    * I use Trac, a web-based issue tracking system.
* Good:
    * Helps us remember what to do.
    * Records of completed tasks can be kept for future reference.
* Improve:
    * Doesn't visualize progress.
    * Seeing the forest for the trees.

## Improvement 3: Log Completed Tasks ##

![I Never Finish Anything](images/i-never-finish.19marksdesign_flickr.jpg)

___

[![Trac Timeline](images/trac-timeline.png)](http://trac.edgewall.org/timeline)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Again, visualizing progress motivates us to keep going.
* How it works:
    * Use some sort of technical aids to keep track of completed tasks so you are able to do retrospection.
* Good:
    * Lets us look backwards as well as forwards.
    * Gives us that warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment.
* Improve:
    * Are we doing the same few things over and over?
    * Are we doing things efficiently?

## Definitions: Tasks, Changes and Habits ##

* **Task**: Something we need to do once and never again.
* **Change**: A transition from a current state to a desired state.
* **Habit**: What we need to do in order to stay in the desired state.

<!-- {notes}
* A silly example:
    * Current state: a lightbulb is broken.
    * Task: Change it.
    * Change: lightbulb now works.
    * Habit: Set up automatic periodic reminders to buy lightbulbs (at whatever frequency I can expect them to break; some iteration/observation may be needed).
* The takeaway:
    * Observe that most problems are likely to reoccur.
    * Introduce habits to prevent them, limit their impact and/or handle them.
{notes} -->

---

## Improvement 4: Make Notes ##

![Scribe](images/scribe.png)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Past solutions can sometimes be reused, but only if we can remember them.
* How it works:
    * Make short notes about problems you encountered and how you solved them.
* Good:
    * We can solve similar problems more easily and/or efficiently in the future.
* Improve:
    * We are doing things, but are we doing the right things?

---

## Improvement 5: Set Up Milestones ##

![Milestone](images/milestone.pikerslanefarm_flickr.jpg)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: A rough estimate of when things can be expected to be completed makes planning of other things easier.
* How it works:
    * Create time slots, e.g. one per month, and assign every task to a slot to indicate when it should be completed.
* Good:
    * Lets us plan better.
* Improve:
    * Prioritize tasks so we can focus on the most important things at all times.

## Improvement 6: Use a Kanban Board ##

![Simple Kanban Board](images/simple-kanban-board.jpg)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Visualizing workload and progress at the same time gives us better overview.
* How it works:
    * Set up a few columns, like "To Do", "Blocked", "In Progress" and "Done".
    * Move tasks between columns to visualize progress.
    * Move important tasks to the top, leaving less important ones further down.
    * Pick new tasks from the top (i.e., the most important ones).
* Good:
    * Great overview of progress.
    * Great overview of prioritization.
* Improve:
    * Why are some tasks being blocked?

## Definition: Yak Shaving ##

![Yak](images/yak.jpg)

___

> [**yak shaving**](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html): Any seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you're working on.
> 
> &mdash; [_The Jargon File_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/index.html)

---

## Improvement 7: Identify Task Dependencies ##

![Dependency Graph](images/depgraph.png)

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Formulating blockages forces us to understand them and enables us to resolve or work around them.
* How it works:
    * When tasks are blocked, figure out why.
    * Make sure there is some other task that can be completed to resolve the blockage.
* Good:
    * Gets rid of gridlock.
    * Identifies bottlenecks.
* Improve:
    * Volume and complexity of tasks growing.

## Improvement 8: Simplify Recurring Tasks ##

* Automate them.
* If they can't be automated, outsource them.
* If they can't be outsourced, create reminders.

<!-- {notes}
* Hypothesis: Spending some time now on spending less time in the future on trivial recurring tasks is a net win.
* Automation:
    * Set up automatic bill payments.
    * Buy a robotic vacuum cleaner.
    * Back up your computer, phone, camera, etc. automatically.
* Outsourcing:
    * Have someone else do your bookkeeping.
    * Hire someone to clean your house.
    * Sell your car.
        * Ride a bike or train or bus to work.
        * Rent a car when you actually need one.
        * With the money you save, take time off from work to do whatever you want.
* Reminders:
    * Use some sort of electronic calendar and create alarms and reminders.
    * Put sticky notes in places where you can't miss them:
        * On the milk carton in the fridge.
        * On the inside of the front door.
        * On the bathroom mirror.
    * If it's not possible to write something down "right now", make it difficult to forget it by using emotions and visual cues:
        * E.g., remember to put a load in the washing machine when you get home by visualizing yourself being attacked by the dirty laundry monster as soon as you enter your front door.
* Take it to the next level:
    * Automate your outsourcing:
        * Divert incoming paperwork to your bookkeeping service.
        * Set up a schedule for your outsourced house cleaning.
        * See if your public transportation pass can be renewed automatically.
    * Automate your reminders:
        * Make them recurring.
        * Have your phone trigger them in specific geographic locations.
    * Outsource your outsourcing:
        * Instead of looking for service providers, use an online service to request tenders for jobs you wish to outsource.
    * Outsource your reminders?

* The best time to make a change is always right now.
* Writing things down means less worrying and more planning.
* Many small changes achieve great results.
* Visualization improves motivation and makes good habits harder to break.
* No "zero days"!

___

### Tools Used ###

* [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org), version 0.12, with plugins:
    * [Date Field Plugin](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/DateFieldPlugin), makes it easier to input dates into fields.
    * [Graphviz Plugin](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GraphvizPlugin), makes it possible to include simple graphs in tickets and wiki pages.
    * [Master Tickets Plugin](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/MasterTicketsPlugin), allows tickets to block other tickets.
* A home-made script to automatically create tickets for recurring tasks (weekly, monthly, annually).
* [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) and [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) for version control.
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and shellscripts for automatic testing, installation, etc.

___

## Possible Future Improvements ##

* Due dates instead of milestones.
* Better focus on "what to do today".
* Accessibility:
    * Email?
    * Smartphone?
    * Twitter?
* Statistics:
    * Tasks completed per month.
    * Tasks completed per project.
    * Cycle time.
